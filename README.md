# Smart-Sleep-Analytics-Automated-Apnea-Detection-using-AI
This project uses machine learning and deep learning to detect whether a person has sleep apnea (a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops during sleep).

It works by taking sleep data — such as breathing patterns or body signals (either real data from PhysioNet or synthetic data you generate) — and then:

Preprocesses the data to clean and organize it.

Extracts features that describe breathing and sleep patterns.

Trains models (like Random Forest, SVM, CNN, LSTM) to recognize patterns that show when apnea happens.

Evaluates how accurately the models can detect apnea and shows the results with clear graphs and visualizations.
